## Description

Our project revolves around the creation of an immersive 3D bowling experience. Leveraging the innovative LEAP motion controller, players can interact with the game environment through intuitive hand and arm movements. This seamless integration allows for precise control over ball trajectories, enhancing the gaming experience as players aim for strikes and spares in a dynamic virtual bowling alley.

## Objective

Our recent focus has been on developing a game tailored for individuals affected by multiple sclerosis. By incorporating arm and hand movements into the gameplay mechanics, our aim is to provide users with a platform for exercising and training these specific body parts.
