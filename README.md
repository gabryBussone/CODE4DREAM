## Desciption
Our project entails the development of a sophisticated 3D bowling game, wherein the mechanics of ball throwing are intricately integrated with the innovative LEAP motion controller. Through seamless interaction with the LEAP device, players experience an immersive and intuitive gaming interface, allowing for precise and natural ball movements as they aim for strikes and spares in a dynamic virtual bowling alley environment.
